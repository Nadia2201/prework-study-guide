# Prework-study-guide Webpage


## Description
 After enrolling as a boot camp student, I had to carry out some prework independently and study the basics of HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript before starting the course. 
 I wanted to make sure that I could review what I have learnt. This project allow me to find my notes structured on a Webpage so I can easily find information.
 While building this project, I have learnt the basics of coding and debugging.
